     * This method finds the row that contains the most number of occurrences of a
     * certain value and returns the row index of that row and the column indexes
     * (in increasing order) where the value occurs in that row.
     * The matrix is represented by a two-dimensional array.
     *
     * Example: if the method is called with the value "3" and the following matrix
     *     (1   3  2  -4)          // <- there is a "3" in column 1
     *     (-3  4  5  -2)
     *     (3   0  3   2)          // <- there is a "3" in column 0 and column 2
     * then the result of the search is:
     *      row=2 , columns=[0,2]
     * because row 2 contains the most number of occurrences of "3" (in columns 0 and 2).
     *
     * Your solution MUST use a thread pool to accelerate the operation.
     *
     * @param matrix a rectangular matrix
     * @param value the value to find
     * @param poolSize the thread pool size
     * @return the result of the search
     *
     * You can assume that there is exactly one row in the matrix with the
     * most number of occurrences of the value.
     * Catch exceptions and ignore them.
