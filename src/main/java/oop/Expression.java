/**
 * This class can be used to build simple arithmetic expression
 * with binary operator +,-,* and involving one variable 'x'.
 *
 * The expression can be
 * 1) evaluated by replacing the variable x with a specific value
 * 2) derivated to obtain a new expression
 *
 * You must modify this class to make it work
 * You can/should extend this class with inner classes the way you want.
 * You can also modify it but you are not allowed to modify the signature
 * of existing methods
 *
 * As a reminder, the formulas for the derivations as are followed
 *  - (f + g)' = f' + g'
 *  - (f*g)' = f'g + fg'
 *  - (x)' = 1
 *  - (C)' = 0 with C a constant
